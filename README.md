# Supervised Learning Project
This project is about looking at a dataset of a telecommunications company and what they can do to keep there customers from "churning" ending their contract with them. Results showed that maybe the company could provide incentives for signing a longer contract, or reduce some of the total fee since indivduals pay the same if not more fee than people who sign a longer contract vs shorter contract.



# Bank Churn Project
The Bank Churning project is taking a look at a dataset provided by Kaggle that have members of a bank that have branches located in Spain, France, and Germany. The results showed an 87 to 88% accuracy in predicting whether or not an customer will leave the bank and close all their products. Result from the data also show that the bank regardless of location could offer incentives to non existing customers and existing customers with only one product to get them to get more than one product when join the bank whether it be and new 2nd account, or a particular loan through that bank, etc.
