# Supervised Learning Project
This project is about looking at a dataset of a telecommunications company and what they can do to keep there customers from "churning" ending their contract with them. Results showed that maybe the company could provide incentives for signing a longer contract, or reduce some of the total fee since indivduals pay the same if not more fee than people who sign a longer contract vs shorter contract.
